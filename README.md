[00:05.89] Tides thrash inside, baby, I'm high octane
[00:13.41] Fever in a shock wave
[00:15.84] My core vibrates in an opium haze
[00:20.92] Yet you think we're the same
[00:34.92] 
[00:23.92] The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
[00:33.66] I thought I uncovered your secrets, but turns out there's more
[00:41.76] You adored me before
[00:50.96] Oh, my good-looking boy
[01:02.46] 
[01:02.62] Play casino holes of my eyeballs
[01:10.77] Roll the dice on my thighs
[01:13.12] You stop for breath and I sped up
[01:16.79] Just to impress you
[01:26.29] 
[01:24.24] The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
[01:34.22] I thought I uncovered your secrets, but turns out there's more
[01:42.57] You adored me before
[01:51.50] Oh, my good-looking boy
[02:03.00] 
[01:55.90] My good-looking boy
[02:01.61] My good-looking boy
[02:05.93] My good-looking boy
[02:10.43] Oh, my good-looking boy
[02:21.93] 
[02:21.41] You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone
[02:31.20] You're not who you are to anyone, to anyone these days
[02:40.96] I'm not who I am to anyone, no, not me at all
[02:49.76] I'm not who I am to anyone these days, not at all
[03:14.26] 
[03:00.05] The skyline falls as I try to make sense of it all
[03:09.62] I thought I uncovered your secrets, but turns out there's more
[03:18.17] You adored me before
[03:27.01] Oh, my good-looking boy
